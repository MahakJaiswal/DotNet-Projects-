overview of Digital_Management project-

The Digital Management project is a web application that allows users to manage visitor details for a particular organization. The project consists of several functionalities, including managing existing visitors, registering new visitors, and user authentication.

The managing existing visitors functionality allows the user to view, edit, and delete the details of visitors who have previously registered. This includes basic information such as the visitor's name, email address, phone number, and the purpose of their visit. The user can also view the date and time of the visitor's previous visits.

The registering new visitors functionality allows the user to register new visitors by filling out a form that captures the visitor's basic information, purpose of their visit, and the date and time of their expected arrival. Once the user has registered a new visitor, the visitor's details are added to the database and can be viewed and managed through the managing existing visitors functionality.

The login form functionality allows the user to log in with their credentials and access the Digital Management system securely. The auto exit visitor functionality automatically checks the visitor's shift time and exits them from the system when their shift time ends.

The Digital Management project is built using modern web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Node.js and MongoDB for the back-end. The project is designed to be scalable and can be easily extended to include additional functionalities such as visitor check-in and check-out.

Overall, the Digital Management project provides a comprehensive solution for managing visitor details and ensuring security for any organization.
